# Web Swing: Rooftop Run

A lightweight HTML5 canvas game where you swing between buildings and eliminate rooftop enemies.

## Run

Open `index.html` in your browser. If you need a local server:

python3 -m http.server 8000 -d /workspace
# then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## Controls

- Right Click or X: Detach web
- A / D: Pump swing (left/right)
- Space: Jump
- F (or Middle Click): Shoot web bolt to defeat enemies
- R: Restart

## Objective

## Notes

- Swing by attaching the web to buildings. Use A/D to pump and gain momentum.
- You can land on rooftops and jump again.
- Web bolts collide with enemies and buildings.
